# Poof!

## Project Description:
A game based on the card game 'Set'. 

Each card is unique in it's four features; **color** (pink, purple, blue), **symbol** (heart, star, or sailboat), **shading** (solid, polka dots, or open), and **number** (1, 2, or 3 shapes). 

A 'Poof!' consists of three cards. Each feature must be all the same or all different on all three cards.

When a card is selected, the borders will animate a sound will play. If a "Poof!" is found all three cards will disappear and a cloud will appear in the place of those cards that says "Poof!".
